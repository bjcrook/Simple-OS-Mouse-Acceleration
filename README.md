# Simple-OS-Mouse-Acceleration

This is a simple mouse acceleration program that allows a user to enjoy their mouse
acceleration settings across any game on their computer.

This program was heavily inspired by the Interception Acceleration Program created by povohat and KovaaK.
[Their application can be found here.](https://github.com/KovaaK/InterAccel)

Besides being a great learning tool for myself, the purpose of creating this program was to create a mouse acceleration program with far less configuration options, leaving only the most basic options in.

This program uses the Interception Driver to capture, and modify mouse movements.
[The driver can be found here.](http://www.oblita.com/interception.html)

To use this program, you must first install the interception driver by running the driver_install.bat file (as an admin). Then you must restart your computer. You should now be able to run the program by running one of the .exe files in either the x64 or x86 folders. To change your acceleration settings, you must modify the settings.cfg file inside of the x64 or x86 folder.

- Acceleration will only be applied while the application is running.
- To close the application either type CTRL+c in the application window, or simply exit out of the application the same way you would quit any other program.
- You must restart the program before any changes made to the settings.cfg file will be applied.
- Almost no error checking is done so if the program is not running correctly make sure your settings.cfg file is formatted properly.

Thank you!
